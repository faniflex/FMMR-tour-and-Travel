            <h2>Ertale(ኤርታሌ)</h2>
            <p>Erta Ale volcano is a large basaltic shield volcano in the Erta Ale volcanic range in 
                the central northern Danakil depression (NE Ethiopia).
                It is famed for its persistent lava lake which has been active during most of 
                the past decades since it was first discovered in the 1960s.

                    <p>Erta Ale is only 613 m high, but as typical for a shield volcano has a very 
                        gentle slopes and a large 40 km diameter base. The summit is truncated by a complex, 
                        elongated 1700 x 600 m wide caldera which contains vast lava flows and several 
                        larger and smaller pit craters, most notably the active north and south crater, 
                        which contains the lava lake at present.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Erta Ale is one of the main attractions of the Danakil, and had became 
                        a popular tour destination in recent years. Unfortunately, the deadly 
                        attack on 4 January 2012 against tourists and scientists camped on the crater rim, 
                        in which several were killed, illustrates that the area is politically unstable 
                        and can be subject to terrorist attacks. Anyone visiting the volcano should be aware of this.
