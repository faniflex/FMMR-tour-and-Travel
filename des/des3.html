            <h2>Ras Dashen(ራስ ዳሽን))</h2>
            <p>Ras Dashen is Ethiopia's highest mountain (4533m).  
                It is also the highest mountain in the Horn of Africa and the tenth highest mountain on the continent.  
                The mountain is also known as Ras Dejen and Ras Dashan.  
                It is located in the Simien Mountains which is an area of rugged mountains, 
                steep ravines and many rare and endemic species.  Every visitor will 
                undoubtedly see the amusing Gelada Baboons.  I was fortunate enough to also see the 
                endangered Walia Ibex and Ethiopian Wolf, the latter being the rarest wild canine in the world, or so I was told.

                    <p>The highest point is Ras Dejen (or Dashen; 14,872 feet [4,533 metres])—
                        the highest peak in Ethiopia—which is situated within the Simien National Park 
                        (a UNESCO World Heritage site). The plateau is drained westward by 
                        the Tekezē and Blue Nile rivers and their tributaries.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Ras Dashen is on the eastern escarpment of the park, 
                        away from the main ridge that sees the majority of visitors. 
                        To access Ras Dashen, you have to camp out in the mountains, 
                        most commonly at the base camp of Ambiko 
                        (although there are more rugged routes for those who really want to get out into the sticks). 
                        It's not possible to hike Ras Dashen while based at a 
                        lodge as the only two lodges, Limalimo Lodge and Simien Lodge, are on the other side of the park.
