            <h2>Aksum(አክሱም))</h2>
            <p>The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia's northern border. 
                They mark the location of the heart of ancient Ethiopia, 
                when the Kingdom of Aksum was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. 
                The massive ruins, dating from between the 1st and the 13th century A.D., 
                include monolithic obelisks, giant stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. 
                Long after its political decline in the 10th century, Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.

                    <p>Situated in the highlands of northern Ethiopia, 
                        Aksum symbolizes the wealth and importance of the civilization of the ancient Aksumite kingdom, 
                        which lasted from the 1st to the 8th centuries AD. The kingdom was at the crossroads of the three continents: 
                        Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman World, and was the most powerful state 
                        between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. 
                        In command of the ivory trade with Sudan, 
                        its fleets controlled the Red Sea trade through the port of Adulis and the inland routes of north eastern Africa.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>The ruins of the ancient Aksumite Civilization covered a wide area in the Tigray Plateau. 
                        The most impressive monuments are the monolithic obelisks, 
                        royal tombs and the palace ruins dating to the 6th and 7th centuries AD.
                        Several stelae survive in the town of Aksum dating between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. 
                        The largest standing obelisk rises to a height of over 23 meters and is exquisitely 
                        carved to represent a nine-storey building of the Aksumites. 
                        It stands at the entrance of the main stelae area. 
                        The largest obelisk of some 33 meters long lies where it fell, 
                        perhaps during the process of erection. It is possibly the largest monolithic stele  that 
                        ancient human beings ever attempted to erect.
